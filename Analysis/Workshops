To import and handle .csv files --> use Pandas




**Workshop 3: Merging and Joining Data in Python**

#to download the data
!mkdir data

#to join instructions
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
%matplotlib inline
plt.style.use('ggplot')
before doing this, make sure to clean the data

#merging into dataframes to add new observations
people3 = pd.concat([people1,people2])

#Clean data (I'm going to focus on one year (2012,I'm going to just look at "Both Sexes" (not focus on one gender,I'm going to get rid of a column of data (the 'Value Footnotes' column) using the drop() method.)
cities = cities[cities['Sex']=='Both Sexes']
cities = cities[cities['Year']==2012]
cities.drop('Value Footnotes', axis=1, inplace=True)

#recap joins, panda has four join methods
- Left Join: use **only** keys from **left** DataFrame. SQL: [left outer join](http://goo.gl/JICveI)
- Right Join: use **only** keys from **right** DataFrame. SQL: [right outer join](http://goo.gl/TrrHjQ)
- Outer Join: use union of **keys from both** DataFrames. SQL: [full outer join](http://goo.gl/bVRqO8)
- Inner Join: use **intersection of keys** from both DataFrames. SQL: [inner join](http://goo.gl/Cf1MF8)
