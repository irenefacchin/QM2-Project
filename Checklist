#Literature Review

Intro:
·  	brief overview of topic and importance, include all definitions 
·  	current model of manufacturing (status quo)
·  	3 areas of environmental impact: water, GHG emissions and hazardous chemicals.
 
Methodologies used in readings to understand and evaluate impact.
 
Solutions suggested by the readings and evidence used to back up sustainability claims.

#Methodologies


#Data Analysis

Convert into python code

Create function forecasting consumption trends of clothing. 
  population forecast (input: population, output: quantity of t-shirts, quantity of jeans bought)
  Higg Index
  Variables:
    Consumption dependent on: age, income, 
    https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-4/pdf/consumer-expenditures-vary-by-age.pdf 
    Spending trends among age groups (multiply these by the forecasted population of each age groups)
    Purchasing power parity

Put data into csv file, add onto Github 
 Put data into csv file, add onto Github
 Explain how you produced that data file (where did the data come from? How did you combine it?)
 How the stats where produced 
 Put dataset into git hub repository (csv)

Create model:
  (Quantity of T-shirts bought in year y2020) x (water usage impact + CO2 emissions impact + chemicals impact) = ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SHIRTS
  (Quantity of Jeans bought in year y2020) x (water usage impact + CO2 emissions impact + chemicals impact) = ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT JEANS
  TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT (in year y2020) =  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SHIRTS + ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT JEANS
  Forecast model: TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT each year y(2020-2050)
  Integrate function: Total impact over the years 


#Data Visualization
1st visualization (t-shirt and jeans graphic)

Total area of shirt divided into 3 and each section is considered as 100% (status quo impact of that variable -- water, CO2 or 
2nd visualization: Forecast model: TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT each year y(2020-2050)
