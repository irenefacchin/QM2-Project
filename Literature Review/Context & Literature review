#Context

As what we wear becomes an increasingly bigger part of our everyday life it is important for everyone to know what the true cost is of the cheap top or jeans which is the forefront of the weekly trends pushed forward by the fashion and textiles industry. We should ask ourselves if adhering to the new trends this season is really worth all the serious and negative impacts that it brings with it.

Our idea centres around the idea of ‘sustainable’ fashion. Traditional models of productivity used by retailers who do not identify as sustainable has been criticised as damaging to the environment. However, our aim is to uncover if sustainable fashion brands are achieving what they claim in reducing the impact of clothing production on the environment or is simply the label of sustainability that drives their decisions on pricing and branding.

Aims:
•	To better understand the methods of production used by the textile industry and what its impacts are on the environment. 
•	To discover what ‘sustainable fashion’ is and how its production differs to traditional methods.
•	To determine whether the ‘sustainable fashion’ movement is the solution to the negative effect of the textiles industry
Objectives:
•	To research the traditional methods used by the textiles industry.
•	To reach out to those working in the ‘sustainable fashion’ industry.
•	To build a model of sustainable fashion methods using various sources for data.
•	Analyse this data to form conclusions about our aims.

#Literature review


Introduction:
We are going to be looking at two different sides of creating of clothes in the fashion industry: sustainable methods versus traditional methods of production. ‘Sustainable fashion is part of the slow fashion movement, developed over the past decades, and used interchangeably with eco-, green-, and ethical-fashion’ (Henninger, Alevizou and Oates 2016). Traditional methods of clothing production operates in a ‘largely linear model of production, sale, use and disposal’ (Pal and Gander 2018, p.253). This current model of clothing production has serious impacts on the environment as ‘non -renewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often used for only a short period’ (The Ellen McArthur Foundation 2017, p.19).
