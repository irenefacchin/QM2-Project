#Context 

As what we wear becomes an increasingly bigger part of our everyday life it is important for everyone to know what the true cost is of the cheap top or jeans which is the forefront of the weekly trends pushed forward by the fashion and textiles industry. 

We want to know if so-called sustainable fashion brands are achieving what they claim in reducing the impact of clothing production on the environment or is simply the label of sustainability that drives their decisions on pricing and branding.

The fashion brand nu-in whom market themselves as sustainable disclose their methods on their website. they use include many of the methods suggested by the aforementioned reports such as recycling and clean dying processes 

They emphasise their use of sustainable materials such as organic cotton and recycled polyester. – contact made and got feedback.



Aims:
•	To better understand the methods of production used by the textile industry and what its impacts are on the environment. 
•	To discover what ‘sustainable fashion’ is and how its production differs to traditional methods.
•	How do the environmental impacts differ?
•	To determine to what extent switching to ‘sustainable fashion’ would reduce the impact on the environment.

Objectives:
•	To research the traditional methods used by the textiles industry.
•	To research and contact specific sustainable brands
•	To build a model of sustainable fashion methods using various sources for data.
•	Analyse this data to form conclusions about our aims.



#Literature Review

We are going to be looking at two opposing styles of manufacturing clothes in the fashion industry: sustainable versus traditional methods of production. Sustainable fashion comes under the ‘slow fashion movement’ which focuses on the ‘sustainability values’ such as using ‘environmentally friendly materials’ (Henninger, Alevizou and Oates 2016). Traditional methods of clothing production operate in a ‘largely linear model of production, sale, use and disposal’ (Pal and Gander 2018, p.253). This current model of clothing production has serious impacts on the environment as ‘non-renewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often used for only a short period’ (The Ellen McArthur Foundation 2017, p.19). We will be looking at the environmental impacts of these production methods mainly in terms of water consumption, Greenhouse Gas emissions and hazardous chemical waste.
 
 
These traditional production methods are not only unsustainable but extremely damaging to the environment. The Ellen McArthur Foundation published a report highlighting the details of the environmental damage done. When an individual buys a t-shirt from one of the countless retailers using traditional production methods, the real cost of the item is excluded from the price tag. The environmental costs include the use of ’93 billion cubic metres of water annually’ which creates ‘problems in water-scarce regions’ (The Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p.20). Additionally, the treatment of textiles through dyeing processes creates toxic wastewater. Currently ‘20% of industrial water pollution globally’ comes from the textiles industry (The Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p.21). The exploitation of water is not the only issue, the status quo for fashion production also releases a large amount of Greenhouse Gases into the atmosphere. In 2015 alone, ‘1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent’ was produced, which is more that ‘international flights and maritime shipping combines’ (The Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p.20). Consequently, CO2 emissions are estimated to rise ‘by more than 60% to nearly 2.8 billion tons per year by 2030’ (The Pulse of the Fashion Industry 2017, p.11). This is why the question still remains of what the best course of action is to tackle these issues.
 
The environmental impact of this industry is a concern voiced by many large-scale charities and corporations along with grassroots campaigners, and many solutions have been proposed. The UN environmental programme in 2018 suggested there is ‘a fundamental problem with the fast fashion business model where revenues are based on selling more products’ and this is why they are trying to create ‘an industry-wide push for action to reduce fashion’s negative social, economic and environmental impact and turn it into a driver for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.’
 
Greenpeace launched a campaign of ‘detoxing the clothing industry’. The aim of the campaign was to ‘achieve zero discharges of hazardous chemicals by 2020’ and a blacklist of dangerous chemicals was introduced (2018 p.5). The participating fashion brands committed to phasing out the use of the blacklisted chemicals as well as frequent wastewater testing (2018, p.26).
 
The Ellen McArthur foundation report: A New Textiles Economy suggests there is too much focus on simply ‘reducing the impact of the current linear system’ but this does not tackle the ‘root cause of the systems wasteful nature’ (2017 p.22). The report sets out ‘4 ambitions’ which includes taking actions such as ‘phase out substances of concern’ and ‘break free from [clothing’s] increasingly disposable nature’ (2017. P.23-25). This approach is meant to be incorporated into existing brands’ product production processes to make them more sustainable.
 
Another idea proposed as to how brands can be more sustainable is to create a ‘sustainable business model’ which puts production methods into a more ‘circular model of reuse and reintegration’ (Pal and Gander 2018). This model focuses on ‘Narrowing the resource loop’ so that fewer natural resources are used, ‘Slowing the resource flow’ by emphasising reusing and repair of items and ‘attempting to close resource flows’ by finding sustainable alternatives (Pal and Gander 2018). This is a more practical approach to using less resources rather than a holistic approach about the nature of fashion.
 
The use of the right material ‘also plays a remarkable role in the sustainability’ of a garment. However, sometimes this point is ‘oversimplified’ and the fabric may not serve the purpose of sustainability in the long run (Aakko and Koskennurmi-Sivonen 2013, p.16).  The main problem is that ‘Frequent laundering of a garment ends up using more energy than what was used in the making of it.’ This is why using materials such as wool, even if not organic will ‘demand less laundering’ and therefore be more sustainable long term (Aakko and Koskennurmi-Sivonen 2013, p.18).
 
It is clear that many reports about how fashion can be more sustainable focus on the resources necessary to produce clothing and the flow and type of materials. It also seems as many brands are adopting this new vision of manufacturing but how do we know if this is enough? Despite efforts to move away from the traditional methods now, will we see the benefits in the future and will this affect how fashion is consumed?
