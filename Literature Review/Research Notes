#A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion’s Future (Ellen MacArthur)
(https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/a-new-textiles-economy-redesigning-fashions-future) 
‘In the last 15 years, clothing production has approximately doubled’ p.18

‘current system for producing, distributing, and using clothing operates in an almost completely linear way’ p.19

‘nonrenewable resources are extracted to produce clothes that are often used for only a short period’ p.19

‘Textiles production (including cotton farming) also uses around 93 billion cubic metres of water annually,20 contributing to problems in some water-scarce regions’ p.20

‘In 2015, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from textiles production totalled 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent,21 more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined.’ P.20

‘textile production discharges 21 high volumes of water containing hazardous chemicals into the environment. As an example, 20% of industrial water pollution globally is attributable to the dyeing and treatment of textiles’ p.21

‘The Citarum River in Indonesia has over 200 textile factories along its banks; these factories release dyes and other chemicals into the water, changing the colour of the river and devastating the local ecosystem.’ P.38

‘If the industry continues on its current path, by 2050, it could use more than 26% of the carbon budget associated with a 2°C pathway.29 Moving away from the current linear and wasteful textiles system is therefore crucial to keeping within reach the 2°C average global warming limit.’ P.21

‘The number of plastic microfibres entering the ocean between 2015 and 2050 could accumulate to an excess of 22 million tonnes.’ P.39

Increased awareness of the negative environmental impacts has spurred change ‘However, most of these efforts are focused on reducing the impact of the current linear system’ 
e.g. ‘using more efficient production techniques or reducing the impact of materials’
but this isn’t ‘tackling the root cause of the system’s wasteful nature directly’
‘low clothing utilisation and… recycling’ p.22

Sets out 4 ‘ambitions’ 

1.	‘Phase out substances of concern and microfibre release’ p. 23

2.	‘Transform the way clothes are designed, sold, and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature’ p.24

3.	‘Radically improve recycling by transforming clothing design, collection, and reprocessing’ p.24

4.	‘Make effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs’ p.25

Outcomes of increased sustainability in brands (if the followed the above ambitions)

‘Lower GHG emissions’ p. 46
‘No leakage of hazardous substances into the environment.’ P. 47
‘Reduced pressure on water in water-scarce regions’ p.47



#UN environmental program
https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/putting-brakes-fast-fashion 
‘The fashion industry produces 20 per cent of global wastewater and 10 per cent of global carbon emissions - more than all international flights and maritime shipping.’

‘Textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of water globally and it takes around 2,000 gallons of water to make a typical pair of jeans.’

‘there is still a fundamental problem with the fast fashion business model where revenues are based on selling more products, and therefore retailers must constantly offer new collections’

‘UN Alliance on Sustainable Fashion to encourage the private sector, governments and non-governmental organizations to create an industry-wide push for action to reduce fashion’s negative social, economic and environmental impact and turn it into a driver for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.’

Destination zero: seven years of detoxing the clothing industry
https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-international-stateless/2018/07/destination_zero_report_july_2018.pdf

‘set up a blacklist of hazardous chemicals.’ MRSL (Manufacturing Restricted substances list) p.5
Phalates which soften plastic coatings is toxic p.12 (see other possible examples of toxic chemicals)
Some toxic chemicals unnecessary ‘gimmicks… with environmental cost’ p.6

‘the textiles industry is a major user of hazardous chemicals ‘ p.7
-	In the global south is especially bad
-	‘multicoloured rivers’ from ‘dyeing processes’
-	‘disrupt hormone systems in humans and/or animals’ – when ingesting water waste.

‘almost all Detox committed brands are wastewater testing’ p.26


#Possible literature to inform on methods/ impacts

some good points e.g. ‘perhaps nontraditional operating logics and value propositions to be considered and applied. One way of doing this is to look at the flow of materials in the fashion system and shift the sector's attitude from the largely linear model of production, sale, use and disposal to a more circular model of reuse and reintegration.’ P.253
Also suggests a ‘sustainable business model’ – could search for this to find data?


‘One way of doing this is to look at the flow of materials in the fashion system and shift the sector's attitude from the largely linear model of production, sale, use and disposal to a more circular model of reuse and reintegration.’

‘Narrowing’ the resource loop means increasing the efficiency of the production and manufacture process so that fewer natural resources are used.’

‘Slowing’ the resource flow uses the reuse and extension/repair of products to lessen overall environmental damage.’

‘Strategies for attempting to ‘close’ resource flows include a range of social and technological resource recovery activities.’

‘freshwater access is unevenly distributed across the planet’ p.11
‘The volume consumed by the fashion industry today is already large with nearly 79 billion cubic meters—enough to fill nearly 32 million Olympic-size swimming pools. GFA and BCG anticipate that water use will increase by 50% by 2030’ p.11
‘because some of the main cotton-producing countries such as China and India are located in areas that are already suffering from high or medium to high levels of water stress.’ P.11
‘as water scarcity becomes more extreme, cotton-growing nations and the fashion industry may face the dilemma of choosing between cotton production and securing clean drinking water.’

‘The industry’s CO2 emissions are projected to increase by more than 60% to nearly 2.8 billion tons per year by 2030’ p.11

‘Through cotton production, the fashion industry is a large user of fertilizers, with cotton consuming 4% of nitrogen fertilizers and phosphorous globally.’ P.11

‘The impacts to human health of water pollution include toxins building up in the body, possibly leading to cancers, acute illnesses, or other conditions.’ P.12

(Henninger, Alevizou and Oates 2016)

sustainable fashion definitions: ‘Sustainable fashion is part of the slow fashion movement, developed over the past decades, and used interchangeably with eco-, green-, and ethical-fashion (Carey and Cervellon, 2014). Sustainable fashion first emerged in the 1960s, when consumers became aware of the impact clothing manufacturing had on the environment and demanded the industry change its practices’

‘Slow fashion and more specifically sustainable fashion seek to empower workers throughout the supply chain, utilise upcycling, recycling, and traditional production techniques, and incorporating renewable and organic raw materials’

‘introducing organic materials or promoting sustainable collections (e.g. H&M conscious line)’

Taken from ‘academic literature’ and a ‘qualitative analysis approach’ p.13

‘The analysis and the model answer the question of which principles and practices should be considered in sustainable fashion design.’ P.13

‘Sustainable development is defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”’ p.13


‘While choosing materials is an essential part of the aesthetic of any design, it also plays a remarkable role in the sustainability aspects of fashion’ p.16
‘Both the resources and the disposal have to be taken into account’in ref to ‘fibres’ p. 16

‘Oversimplified statements about the qualities of fabrics may be misguiding, which in the end may not serve the realization of sustainable fashion.’p.16

‘There are attempts to reduce the environmental impacts of finishing, such as merging the processing stages and using updated methods that consume a minimum amount of water and energy. The European Commission (2003) has created a reference document for the best available techniques (BAT) for the textile industry, particularly for its production phase.’ P.17

‘Frequent laundering of a garment ends up using more energy than what was used in the making of it. Therefore, choosing materials with forethought of the use phase makes a difference. For example, some materials, such as wool, demand less laundering, and others’ p.18

‘In addition to saving energy, alternative energy sources could be utilized.’ P.18
