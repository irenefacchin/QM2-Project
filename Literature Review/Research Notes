Intro: 
•	brief overview of topic and importance, include all definitions  
•	current model of manufacturing (status quo)
•	3 areas of environmental impact: water, GHG emissions and hazardous chemicals.

Methodologies used in readings to understand and evaluate impact.

Solutions suggested by the readings and evidence used to back up sustainability claims.

‘The fashion industry produces 20 per cent of global wastewater and 10 per cent of global carbon emissions - more than all international flights and maritime shipping.’

‘Textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of water globally and it takes around 2,000 gallons of water to make a typical pair of jeans.’

‘there is still a fundamental problem with the fast fashion business model where revenues are based on selling more products, and therefore retailers must constantly offer new collections’

‘UN Alliance on Sustainable Fashion to encourage the private sector, governments and non-governmental organizations to create an industry-wide push for action to reduce fashion’s negative social, economic and environmental impact and turn it into a driver for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.’

‘set up a blacklist of hazardous chemicals.’ MRSL (Manufacturing Restricted substances list) p.5
Phalates which soften plastic coatings is toxic p.12 (see other possible examples of toxic chemicals)
Some toxic chemicals unnecessary ‘gimmicks… with environmental cost’ p.6

‘the textiles industry is a major user of hazardous chemicals ‘ p.7
-	In the global south is especially bad
-	‘multicoloured rivers’ from ‘dyeing processes’
-	‘disrupt hormone systems in humans and/or animals’ – when ingesting water waste.

‘almost all Detox committed brands are wastewater testing’ p.26


#Possible literature to inform on methods/ impacts

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618303056?casa_token=39O7fb4gMe8AAAAA:dGQ7AvJWAzsxYJV5DSPoyVtxJxBt7_veNDmVJqBTpospUV1kr9Zs_5OuGyuvJnQBDwSvEQXB1g

some good points e.g. ‘perhaps nontraditional operating logics and value propositions to be considered and applied. One way of doing this is to look at the flow of materials in the fashion system and shift the sector's attitude from the largely linear model of production, sale, use and disposal to a more circular model of reuse and reintegration.’ P.253
Also suggests a ‘sustainable business model’ – could search for this to find data?
