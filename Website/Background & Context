As what we wear becomes an increasingly bigger part of our everyday life, demand for cheap and “trendy” clothing is rising, with consumers chasing weekly trends pushed forward by the fashion and textiles industry. Yet, the increasing awareness and concern about climate change, leads to questions about the true cost of the “cheap” items we buy.

With clothing production having doubled in the last 15 years, it is very likely that this will increase further as the population rises. World Data Lab estimates that our population is almost at 7.8 billion people, with 3.6 billion making up the middle class. Now, not only are essential clothing items needed, but with a rising middle class, there is a demand for new, cheap and fashionable clothes daily. Producing this enormous amount of clothing does not come without disastrous consequences to the environment, such as depleting resources, water pollution and further climate change. This Ted Ed video demonstrates the significant environmental damage caused by the production of a single t-shirt.

Our goal is to visually communicate the immense environmental cost of the current fashion industry – which focuses on quickly producing and distributing new, trending clothing items to the increasingly insatiable consumer. This project focuses on water usage and CO2 emissions. By also investigating the environmental impacts of the relatively few “sustainable” brands in the industry, we aim to contrast the environmental impacts of their production methods to those of fast fashion brands to answer the following question:

What impact would switching to buying exclusively from sustainable brands have on the environment?
