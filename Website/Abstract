Abstract

An overview of our Project

Motivation

For our module Quantitative Methods and Data Analysis (at UCL), we have decided to investigate the environmental impacts of the fashion industry. Rising concern about climate change has brought attention to the unsustainable practices of the fashion industry. Our aim is to contrast the environmental impacts of “fast-fashion” brands with those of “sustainable” brands to inform the consumer of the true cost of their clothing purchases.

Research Questions

How do the environmental impacts of sustainable fashion brands compare with fast-fashion manufacturing methods? What impact would switching to buying exclusively from sustainable brands have on the environment?

Hypothesis

We expect the environmental impacts (water usage, CO2 emissions) for the fast fashion industry to continue to increase. We expect switching to buying exclusively from sustainable brands will significantly decrease the environmental impacts of the industry.

Approach

Our approach will be to create a model to estimate the environmental impacts (water usage, CO2 emissions) of the fashion industry.

Results

If the fashion industry totally switches from fast to sustainable in 2021, there could be a 77% decrease in CO2 Emissions, and 44% decrease in Water Usage by 2030.
