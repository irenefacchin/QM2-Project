# Meet the Team

## Irene Facchin
Hey! My name is Irene and I am Italian but I grew up in Switzerland and China. As a second year Arts and Sciences student at UCL, I am tailoring my degree to focus on my interests in economics, education and development. My hobbies are hiking, hanging out with friends and watching documentaries.
