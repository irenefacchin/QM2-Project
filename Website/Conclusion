Conclusion
As seen in the final visualisations, sustainable fashion is an impactful substitute to fast fashion; in less than 10 years, only buying sustainable clothing would reduce water usage by more than 70% and decrease CO2 emissions by 42% . These percentages may even be higher as we conducted our analysis using conservative data/data points to make sure to not overestimate our results. For example, to determine the demand for clothing, we decided to consider only the size of the middle class, rather than the whole population. Analyzing the whole population would have likely made our results too high, since low class individuals would not contribute to demand nearly as much as middle/upper class individuals. Another conservative decision was assuming that clothing demand is solely fulfilled by t-shirt and jeans, which in contrast to other clothing items are significantly less damaging to the environment. Therefore, when adding the environmental impact of all items of clothing to our study, the saved CO2 emissions and water would be even higher.

Sustainable fashion is therefore a great substitute to fast fashion, but there are other alternative ways to reduce the environmental impact of your fashion decisions. In particular, buying recycled clothes and thrifting second-hand items are two ways to reduce your demand for new clothes and promote a circular life cycle in the fashion industry. This would also improve the fashion industryâ€™s ethics. Shopping already-worn clothes or clothes made from existing fabrics would make the fashion industry almost environmental impact-free!
