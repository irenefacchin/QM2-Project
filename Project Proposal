#Suggest/sketch methods for presenting data/results
To present the results, we are planning on using different data visualizations in order to have a complete analysis of the subject. First of all, we will compare, in a column chart, the researched sustainable brands based on different environmental factors (CO2 emissions, water consumption, waste...). We will then rank the sustainable brands in a table. To conclude, we will analyze what would happen in the future if everyone switched to sustainable fashion. To visualize this, we will take an existing linear graph predicting the fashion industry’s environmental impact over the next 50 years, and add our predictions concerning the sustainable fashion’s environmental impact.
