#Suggest/sketch methods for analysis/processing of data
Investigate potential correlation between average selling price and each stage of supply chain practices e.g. carbon footprint(statistica), sustainable cotton(statistica), visualised as a scatter plot with the line of best fit.
Fast fashion brand versus sustainable brand energy pathway in the supply chain illustrated in a sankey diagram. Calculate % of energy loss to compare between different company scales.
Rate of production of clothing; fashion industry carbon footprint over time against time illustrated as two curves on the same distribution graph.

#Suggest/sketch methods for presenting data/results
To present the results, we are planning on using different data visualizations in order to have a complete analysis of the subject. First of all, we will compare, in a column chart, the researched sustainable brands based on different environmental factors (CO2 emissions, water consumption, waste...). We will then rank the sustainable brands in a table. To conclude, we will analyze what would happen in the future if everyone switched to sustainable fashion. To visualize this, we will take an existing linear graph predicting the fashion industry’s environmental impact over the next 50 years, and add our predictions concerning the sustainable fashion’s environmental impact.
