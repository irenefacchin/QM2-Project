# Brainstorming
## Key 
Good data to use (csv)
Not so good data to use
articles to look at 
good articles that have already been looked at 


comparing fast fashion data to sustainable fashion brands
find a question, based on the data
ask if our subject is too broad, and if so, which way is the best to go, also considering we’ll adapt to the data sets found
narrow it down to water, plastic, CO2 emissions, chemicals, animals, labour ?
H&M group
literature review, write down any good article or material.

We read your article __ about __, and were especially interested in__. We were wondering if you could direct us to your resources, or guide us towards a place where we could find this sort of data. We would be extremely grateful for your help.

Thank you in advance,
