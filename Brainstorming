## Key 
Good data to use (csv)
Not so good data to use
articles to look at 
good articles that have already been looked at 


comparing fast fashion data to sustainable fashion brands
find a question, based on the data
ask if our subject is too broad, and if so, which way is the best to go, also considering we’ll adapt to the data sets found
narrow it down to water, plastic, CO2 emissions, chemicals, animals, labour ?
H&M group
literature review, write down any good article or material.


## Email structure for data requests :

Dear __

I hope this email finds you well. 
We are a team of five University College London undergraduates studying an interdisciplinary degree called Arts and Sciences. As part of our research and data analysis project for our Quantitative Methods module, we are creating a report on the impact of fast fashion on the environment. We read your article __ about __, and were especially interested in__. We were wondering if you could share with us the data you used (preferably not in pdf format) or direct us towards any resources where we might find open data on the matter. We would be extremely grateful for your help.

Thank you in advance,

Kind regards,
